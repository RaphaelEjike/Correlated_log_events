# Correlated log events the key to operational effectiveness  
Cyber-attacks come in many flavours distributed denial of service, virus, SQL injection, Cross site scripting etc. This is why it is imperative to correlate log events across different data sources—firewalls, endpoints, databases, and web servers. This can reveal patterns that single logs alone cannot, highlighting potential attacks before they become successful breaches.

This is becoming increasing more important because of the challenging landscape defenders face: attackers only need one successful exploit, while defenders must secure a vast range of assets. By effectively correlating log events, defenders can break down this asymmetry, uncovering connections that might otherwise go unnoticed. For example, a lone SQL injection attempt might seem benign, but if seen alongside unusual traffic from the same IP or unusual login attempts, it could signal a coordinated attack.

With tools like Microsoft Sentinel, which offers robust analytics rules, you can automate threat detection across these correlated events. Sentinel's analytics rules allow users to aggregate events into incidents, which provides security teams with context-rich insights into attacks. This way, they can identify an attack in its early stages rather than responding to isolated events after the fact.

### 1. The Value of Contextual Analysis

Correlating log data enables defenders to go beyond isolated events and see the full picture of a potential security incident. Single events, like a failed login attempt or a request to an unfamiliar endpoint, may appear benign in isolation. However, by correlating these logs across different data sources, defenders can understand the context—allowing them to focus on incidents with a high likelihood of being genuine threats.

In Microsoft Sentinel, for instance, analytics rules can identify patterns by aggregating and correlating multiple data points, such as login anomalies across endpoints, or sudden access attempts on sensitive systems. By building a story around these connections, Sentinel helps security teams recognize and prioritize high-risk alerts. Contextual analysis also reduces the noise of false positives, which often clutter alerts in traditional monitoring systems, thereby making detection faster and more precise.

### 2. Examples of Correlation Rules in Action
Here are a few practical examples where correlation rules can greatly improve detection accuracy:

- Brute Force and Privilege Escalation: A brute-force attempt might appear as a cluster of failed login attempts from a single IP address. If this is followed by a successful login and privilege escalation activity on the same user account, a correlation rule would flag this combination as suspicious. Sentinel would generate a priority incident that points to a compromised user account, which requires immediate investigation.
- Suspicious Data Exfiltration: Imagine a scenario where a user logs in from an unusual location, downloads a high volume of data from a secure database, and immediately logs out. Individually, these actions might pass unnoticed. However, a correlation rule combining these events could detect and alert on this sequence as a potential data exfiltration attempt, giving the security team critical context to act promptly.
- Malware and Lateral Movement: Suppose there’s an alert about a malicious file detected on one endpoint, followed by abnormal network activity on several adjacent endpoints. Correlating these events could point to lateral movement of malware through the network, suggesting that the attacker is attempting to escalate the breach. This allows security teams to block the threat across multiple endpoints before significant damage occurs.
